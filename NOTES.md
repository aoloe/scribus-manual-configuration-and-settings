## Configuration vs. settings

it's not a bad idea to close all documents before changing settings but it's not necessary.

except for some settings like the list of available fonts, settings can be changed at any time and will be applied as soon as you confirm them.

and here comes the reason why it might be simpler to close all documents first:

- settings that modify the Scribus behavior (like the user interface language) are directly applied.
- changes that apply to the documents (like the color management settings) will be applied to the document you will be creating in the future but not the open ones and not to the existing documents that you will open.

... since -- at first -- this is hard to grasp, you'd indeed better close all documents, and spare yourself some doubts.  
but if this gets cumbersome, there is a faster way, once you become a Scribus expert.
